# Stroke Visual Rehabilitation - Memory

A recreation of the card game memory. A card can be flipped if the player maintains their gaze on the card for 1 second. The goal is to find matching cards by keeping in mind the cards you have already seen. This project is apart of the suite of games created for the stroke rehabilatation project. This game was created in Unity using c# scripts and Tobii's eye tracker and SDK. This was one of my contributions to the overall project.
